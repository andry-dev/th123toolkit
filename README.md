This is a table that will help you to identify the programs.
For "data" i mean the "data" folder found in th123X.dat [the X is the letter]


To extract strings from exe use strings and istrings.

I included the sources of the programs (tools/Other/src) extracted from another GitHub.

I compiled those programs but i didn't make them.

This took me two days, i don't think somebody would google in japanese or download VB.
