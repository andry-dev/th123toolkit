; The CMD file.
;
; Two parts: 1. Command definition and  2. State entry
; (state entry is after the commands def section)
;
; 1. Command definition
; ---------------------
; Note: The commands are CASE-SENSITIVE, and so are the command names.
; The eight directions are:
;   B, DB, D, DF, F, UF, U, UB     (all CAPS)
;   corresponding to back, down-back, down, downforward, etc.
; The six buttons are:
;   a, b, c, x, y, z               (all lower case)
;   In default key config, abc are are the bottom, and xyz are on the
;   top row. For 2 button characters, we recommend you use a and b.
;   For 6 button characters, use abc for kicks and xyz for punches.
;
; Each [Command] section defines a command that you can use for
; state entry, as well as in the CNS file.
; The command section should look like:
;
;   [Command]
;   name = some_name
;   command = the_command
;   time = time (optional -- defaults to 15 if omitted)
;
; - some_name
;   A name to give that command. You'll use this name to refer to
;   that command in the state entry, as well as the CNS. It is case-
;   sensitive (QCB_a is NOT the same as Qcb_a or QCB_A).
;
; - command
;   list of buttons or directions, separated by commas.
;   Directions and buttons can be preceded by special characters:
;   slash (/) - means the key must be held down
;          egs. command = /D       ;hold the down direction
;               command = /DB, a   ;hold down-back while you press a
;   tilde (~) - to detect key releases
;          egs. command = ~a       ;release the a button
;               command = ~D, F, a ;release down, press fwd, then a
;          If you want to detect "charge moves", you can specify
;          the time the key must be held down for (in game-ticks)
;          egs. command = ~30a     ;hold a for at least 30 ticks, then release
;   dollar ($) - Direction-only: detect as 4-way
;          egs. command = $D       ;will detect if D, DB or DF is held
;               command = $B       ;will detect if B, DB or UB is held
;   plus (+) - Buttons only: simultaneous press
;          egs. command = a+b      ;press a and b at the same time
;               command = x+y+z    ;press x, y and z at the same time
;   You can combine them:
;     eg. command = ~30$D, a+b     ;hold D, DB or DF for 30 ticks, release,
;                                  ;then press a and b together
;   It's recommended that for most "motion" commads, eg. quarter-circle-fwd,
;   you start off with a "release direction". This matches the way most
;   popular fighting games implement their command detection.
;
; - time (optional)
;   Time allowed to do the command, given in game-ticks. Defaults to 15
;   if omitted
;
; If you have two or more commands with the same name, all of them will
; work. You can use it to allow multiple motions for the same move.
;
; Some common commands examples are given below.
;
; [Command] ;Quarter circle forward + x
; name = "QCF_x"
; command = ~D, DF, F, x
;
; [Command] ;Half circle back + a
; name = "HCB_a"
; command = ~F, DF, D, DB, B, a
;
; [Command] ;Two quarter circles forward + y
; name = "2QCF_y"
; command = ~D, DF, F, D, DF, F, y
;
; [Command] ;Tap b rapidly
; name = "5b"
; command = b, b, b, b, b
; time = 30
;
; [Command] ;Charge back, then forward + z
; name = "charge_B_F_z"
; command = ~60$B, F, z
; time = 10
; 
; [Command] ;Charge down, then up + c
; name = "charge_D_U_c"
; command = ~60$D, U, c
; time = 10

; These 11 Single Button and Hold Dir commands must be placed here at the top
; of the CMD, above all other commands, and in the standard order shown here,
; in order for the "Compatibly Partnered" version (9742) of the helper AI
; activation method to work with different partners in simul team mode.
; (When the partner is not compatible, then it's best to just use the regular
; version (9741) and rely on the XOR method for backup in case a human
; partner's input turns off the CPU partner's AI.)
; (Now, even if you do not intend to give your character any custom AI, it
; would still be nice if you would place the commands at the top of your CMD,
; for the sake of other characters which do use this AI activation method.
; And then, define Anim 9741 in your AIR file to indicate to other characters
; that your character is compatible.
; It may slightly increase the chances of faulty AI activation if the user is
; using characters with a poor implementation of the old humanly-impossible
; commands AI activation method when fighting against your character, but
; other than that, there's really no particular reason not to.  And you can
; change the names of the commands if you want.  For compatibility, all that
; really matters is the "command" and "time" parameters.)
;
; Another important point to make, is that if you want to add additional
; definitions for any of these basic command names, then there are limits on
; what kind of parameters you can use, in order to ensure the reliability of
; the helper method.  That is, if you redefine any of these first 11 commands,
; then you must follow these rules when doing so:
; - Don't use any command string that includes any tildes. (e.g. no "~x",
;   no "~30D")
; - In the command string, don't include any direction that isn't preceeded by
;   a slash. (e.g. no "F", no "$D")
; - Don't put any non-slashed buttons in a command string overloading one of
;   the Hold Dir command names.
; - Using a command string that includes any commas (e.g. no "a,b"), and/or
;   setting the time parameter to greater than 1, may be safe, but I wouldn't
;   risk it.
; An example of what is permissible, is redefining the "z" button like so:
;	[Command]
;	name = "z"
;	command = y+b
;	time = 1
; Other than that particular common type of redefinition, it's probably best
; to simply avoid adding definitions for these 11 command names altogether.
; And remember, this paragraph just has to do with the helper method.  You'll
; still need to make changes to the XOR code, no matter what type of overloading
; you use with the commands used by it.

; Here add matching commands for any moves that must never be used randomly

; and add to the XOR VarSet controller's triggers accordingly.  You should
; use button-only commands before using any commands with directional
; components, as the latter apparently doesn't work in Linux Mugen 2002.04.14.

; And of course, if you've run out of unique command labels (Mugen allows

; to modify the XOR VarSet controller's triggers accordingly, but Mugen

; 2. State entry
; --------------
; This is where you define what commands bring you to what states.
;
; Each state entry block looks like:
;   [State -1, Label]           ;Change Label to any name you want to use to
;                               ;identify the state with.
;   type = ChangeState          ;Don't change this
;   value = new_state_number
;   trigger1 = command = command_name
;   . . .  (any additional triggers)
;
; - new_state_number is the number of the state to change to
; - command_name is the name of the command (from the section above)
; - Useful triggers to know:
;   - statetype
;       S, C or A : current state-type of player (stand, crouch, air)
;   - ctrl
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player has control. Unless "interrupting" another
;                move, you'll want ctrl = 1
;   - stateno
;       number of state player is in - useful for "move interrupts"
;   - movecontact
;       0 or 1 : 1 if player's last attack touched the opponent
;                useful for "move interrupts"
;
; Note: The order of state entry is important.
;   State entry with a certain command must come before another state
;   entry with a command that is the subset of the first.  
;   For example, command "fwd_a" must be listed before "a", and
;   "fwd_ab" should come before both of the others.
;
; For reference on triggers, see CNS documentation.
;
; Just for your information (skip if you're not interested):
; This part is an extension of the CNS. "State -1" is a special state
; that is executed once every game-tick, regardless of what other state
; you are in.

;==================================================================================
;======| RELACIONADO À AI - AI RELATED |===========================================
;==================================================================================

; The main purpose of having these next two controllers here at the top of
